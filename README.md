Brachiation Theory Analytical Prediction
======================================

Brachiation theory predicts the rheological behavior of dynamically-associating polymer networks. The code in this respository calculates the analytical prediction of the rheology of such a polymer network as dictated by brachiation theory. 

An example plot of the predicted rheology is included.
